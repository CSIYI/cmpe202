I got the example Observer Design Pattern code from http://www.newthinktank.com/2012/08/observer-design-pattern-tutorial/.
I remove thread from the original code.
I added the lambda expression in StockGrabber.java, in function notifyObserver() ,line 53.
Compare to regular for loop, Lambda provides more concise and more readable way of writing codes.
In performance, I believe there is no big difference in these two ways for this example.
